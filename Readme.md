# WPF Spreadsheet - How to Apply Conditional Formatting to a Range of Cells

This example illustrates how to get started with conditional formatting that can be applied to cells that match a certain condition specified by a conditional formatting rule.</p><p>In particular, this sample demonstrates how to use the SpreadsheetControl API to create the following types of conditional formatting rules:
* A rule that formats cells whose values are above or below the average
* A rule that highlights cells whose values are between or not between two specified values
* A rule that formats top or bottom-ranked values
* A rule that highlights cells containing the given text
* A rule that formats unique or duplicate values, blank cells, and formula errors
* A rule that highlights cells containing dates in the specified time period
* A rule that formats cells whose values meet the condition expressed by the relational operator
* A rule that uses a formula to determine which cells to format
* A two-color scale conditional formatting rule
* A three-color scale conditional formatting rule
* A data bar conditional formatting rule
* An icon set conditional formatting rule
